# CloudBuilder
Native C++ SDK for Clan of the Cloud

## Downloading

Download the desired version (in .7z form, requiring 7-zip to decompress) from the [releases page](https://github.com/clanofthecloud/cloudbuilder/releases) below.

In order to get started, start with [the documentation](http://clanofthecloud.github.io/cloudbuilder/).

This SDK works with Clan of the Cloud. For more information and configuring your application, visit http://www.clanofthecloud.com/.

## Compiling

Compiling is rather complicated and if you simply want to use the library, we encourage you to start by downloading a precompiled version of the SDK from the releases page.

In order to compile, you need the delivery directory. You can obtain it by checking out the cloudbuilder-tools repository and putting it side-by-side with the cloudbuilder repository on your local machine. Compiling all the sub-projects will put their results ready for use in a directory cloudbuilder-tools/../cloudbuilder/delivery.

In order to get started quickly, you can download a precompiled version on the Google Drive. This file may be updated often, it is currently dated from Sun, Dec 6 of 2015.
